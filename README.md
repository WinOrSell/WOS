# WOS
Official repository for the WOS Token Project

## Add WOS to MetaMask
To add WOS to your metamask wallet you need to select add tokens under the Assets tab. Just paste in the token address 0xf91e6e28c3fef7b05d27ee8f5b802d8a425b58f0 and add the token! Currently the WOS token will not show the icon on metamask so do not be shocked when a random icon is shown.

## Tokenomics
The WOS token is built to reward buyers and punish sellers. When sent, the seller is punished with an automatic burning of 1 token from the senders wallet. This rewards the reciever/buyer with an immediate shrinking supply. Eventually this means that two tokens will be left and the owner of that wallet will send 1 token and burn the other. The recieving wallet will now have the last token and will be automatically rewarded with 250 Million freshly minted tokens for being the last to hold.

#### Total Supply: 1 Billion

#### Give-aways: 300 Million

#### For Liquidity: 150 Million.

#### To Be Burned: 100 tokens + 1 token per transaction

#### To Be Sold: 549,999,900

#### Shrinking Supply: Burning 1 token every transaction forces a constant shrinking supply.

# Sector
WinOrSell is at its very core a high stakes financial/economic game. The winners are the ones who can use the game to create wealth. The losers are those who cannot handle the emotional rollercoaster of holding/buying. Essentially the losers are the sellers.

# Where to purchase/sell WOS tokens
The WOS token is now available to trade on Uniswap. The information link is https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/tokens/0xf91e6e28c3fef7b05d27ee8f5b802d8a425b58f0. To trade MATIC for WOS: Go to Uniswap and choose the polygon network. Select MATIC to swap and then click Manage Token List. Here you can paste the token address 0xf91e6e28c3fef7b05d27ee8f5b802d8a425b58f0 and add the WOS token. Currently there is very little liquidity and no trading volume. After an airdrop more liquidity will be added and trading will begin!

# GiveAways
Every round (a round ends when 1 token is left) will start with a total supply of 1 Billion tokens. We will be gifting a total of 300 Million tokens every round. To be one of these people you must follow us on twitter @WinOrSell and add our token to your MetaMask (or other) wallet. The contract address to add the token is: 
0xf91e6e28c3fef7b05d27ee8f5b802d8a425b58f0

# 1 Round/Cycle Example:
100 Tokens are minted to the contract. 999,999,900 Tokens are minted to the WinOrSell team address for a total supply of 1 Billion. 300 Million tokens are given away. The WinOrSell team supplies Liquidity pools with a minimum of 150 Million tokens. The first 100 transactions burns all of the tokens in the contract. After that, every transaction burns a token from the senders wallet.

Eventually 2 tokens are left. The owner sends one to another wallet and the other is burned. The wallet recieving the last token is automatically minted 250 Million tokens. The WinOrSell team mints the remaining 749,999,999 tokens to reach a total supply of 1 Billion. The next round begins.
